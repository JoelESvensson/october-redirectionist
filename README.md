# Redirectionist â€“ a redirection plugin for OctoberCMS

Currrently a work in progress.

The plan is to create a plugin that redirection using the built in Laravel Router.
All redirections are saved in the database.

In the future, the redirections will also be specifiable in a YAML format that is
saved in the theme. Which is useful for version control purposes.
